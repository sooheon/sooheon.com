Clojure, free will, kettlebells, whatever else.

Begin writing a new draft with `boot new-post`. Currently using
[Netlify](netlify.com) for CI (just running `boot build target` on the `master`
branch for me) and hosting.

Thanks to makers of [perun](perun.io) for the code making this possible, and to
Paulus Esterhazy's [presumably.de](presumably.de) for inspiration. CSS is
(heavily) inspired by from [Klim Type Foundry](klim.co.nz).
