I attended the Seoul Forum 2017.

Objective of robotics is not to replace humans" Really? Driverless cars obviously free
time for you. She wants "pervasive" robots - what are the economics implications? What
needs to be done today to improve success tomorrow?

"Autonomy at rest"

Cancer diagnose error: Human 3.5%, AI 7.5%, AI + Human 0.5%, this is proof that robots are
tools "for the people, by the people"

However, today's algorithms are one-off, and by Experts Only.

## Questions
I want to ask this question because the talk is titled "prosperity and coexistence". You
gave us a very good overview of the potential for prosperity, but what is left unsaid is
that autonomous robots represent the first time in history that capital can produce value
without labor. Before, it used to be that whether you had a farm, or a factory, or a hedge
fund, you needed to employ labor to create value.

The majority of those trillions of dollars of gains will go to the owners of the means of
production, namely owners of autonomous capital. What are your thoughts on this coming
economic problem?

autonomy and robots = oil refineries with no employees, only owners.
